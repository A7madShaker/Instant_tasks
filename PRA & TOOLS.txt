What is RPA?
RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a technology that uses software "bots" to automate repetitive,
 rule-based tasks by mimicking human interactions with digital systems.
 In web scraping, RPA bots extract data from websites (e.g., news, social media,
 e-commerce) automatically. In automation, RPA handles tasks like data entry, report generation, or integrating scraped data into other systems.

Handles dynamic websites with JavaScript or CAPTCHAs.
RPA in Automation:
Transfers scraped data to spreadsheets, CRMs, or databases.

Streamlines business processes by connecting systems.
